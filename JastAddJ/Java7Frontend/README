JastAddJ7
---------

JastAddJ7 is an extension to the JastAddJ Java compiler. More precisely,
it is an extension to the JastAddJ Java 1.5 extension which implements the
changes in JSR334 / Project Coin for Java 7.

You need to have all of the JastAddJ source directories in a common root
in order to be able to compile JastAddJ7. This means that the directories

Java1.4Frontend
Java1.4Backend
Java1.5Frontend
Java1.5Backend
Java7Frontend
Java7Backend

all need to be sibling directories. If you are only want to build the
frontend, it would suffice to have only the fronten directories.

Licenses
--------

JastAddJ is licenced under the modified BSD license. It is included in the
licenses directory.

Using the Ant script
--------------------

Building of JastAddJ7 is handled by Apache Ant. If you have Ant
installed you can get a list of Ant targets:

$ ant -p

It should tell you something like:

Main targets:

 build   Compile Java7Backend
 clean   Remove all generated and compiled files
 jar     Build binary packages
 source  Build a source distribution
Default target: build

If you just want to compile the backend, and don't care about packaging
you can simply run ant in the Java7Backend directory and it will compile
everything. Note that you must have the rest of the JastAddJ directories
as sibling directories.

Running Ant on Windows
----------------------

The build script should work fine on Windows, with the exception of the
exec task. If this fails it's because Ant is not in your PATH environment
variable already.
