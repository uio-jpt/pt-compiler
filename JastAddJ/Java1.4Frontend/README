Java1.4Frontend - Version R20071019

The Java1.4Frontend performs static-semantic checking including name analysis
and type analysis and compile-time error checking. It is a high-quality
implementation that passes almost all tests in the jacks test suite (more than
javac and jikes).

A main program JavaPrettyPrinter is included that parses Java source code,
performs static-semantic checking and prettyprints the programs to standard
output. 

BUILDING

All tools needed (jastadd2, jflex, beaver, etc.) are included. You only need to
have javac and Apache Ant installed in order to continue. An example ant build file is
included.
