Java1.4Backend - Version R20071019

The Java1.4Backend is an extension of the Java1.4Frontend to form a full Java
compiler, generating Java bytecode. The compiler is reasonably fast: around 3
times slower than javac.

A main program JavaCompiler is included that parses Java source code,
performs static-semantic checking and generated .class files.

BUILDING

This module depends on the Java1.4Frontend available at http://www.jastadd.org
All tools needed (jastadd2, jflex, beaver, etc.) are included. You only need to
have javac and Apache Ant installed in order to continue. An example ant build
file is included.

RUNNING

Usage: java JavaCompiler <options> <source files>
  -verbose                  Output messages about what the compiler is doing
  -classpath <path>         Specify where to find user class files
  -sourcepath <path>        Specify where to find input source files
  -bootclasspath <path>     Override location of bootstrap class files
  -extdirs <dirs>           Override location of installed extensions
  -d <directory>            Specify where to place generated class files
  -help                     Print a synopsis of standard options
