PT HOWTO
========

The actual implementation is located in the directory `PTFrontend`.

    $ git clone git@github.com:uio-jpt/pt-compiler.git
    $ cd pt-compiler/PTFrontend


### Building the compiler

    $ ant jar

The jar file is created in the directory `PTFrontend/build/jar`.


### Running tests

    $ ant testall       # semantic tests
    $ ant testcompile   # test compiling valid tests


### Running the compiler

    $ java -jar build/jar/JPT.jar <inputfolder> [-o <folder_name>] [-v]

Output folder defaults to `{inputfolder}_output`.


  
## Usage Examples

In the following, input folder is `resources/sample_projects/test-pt`;
Output is `resources/sample_projects/test-pt_output`.

    $ java -jar build/jar/PTCompiler.jar resources/sample_projects/test-pt

Same as above, with verbose flag on:

    java -jar build/jar/PTCompiler.jar -v resources/sample_projects/test-pt

Outputfolder specified:

    $ java -jar build/jar/PTCompiler.jar resources/sample_projects/test-pt -o /tmp/pt-out



## Launcher script

There is also a bash script `run` that can be used instead of typing
`java -jar build/jar/JPT.jar`.

This script will pr default set output directory to `./output`.
For more information about this, use

    $ ./run -h
