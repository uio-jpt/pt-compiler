* TODO
** DONE Implement tabstract
** TODO Write a test-runner
   - Make it trivial to compile and execute programs
     - needs a updated build.xml?
   - Make it trivial to check that expected output is sane
   - Add a main class option to manifest?

   - [ ] field renaming does not work for usages of field.
         class X {
            int x;
            int getX(){ return x; }
         }
         inst X => Y(x -> y)
         class Y {
            int y;
            int getX(){ return x; }
         }
