** TODO Implement tabstract
   - [ ] Sol-1
   - [ ] Sol-2

* TODO Sol-1
  - Have a own tabstract method type
  - Check that it's not present in Package class

** Things to check
   - [X] are methods renamed before they're copied into a class?
   - [ ] Is it possible to know why a class was renamed?
     - [ ] needs extra information
   - [ ] Is it possible to know that a tabstract class was renamed
     because of an overriding method?

** What makes it difficult
    - When a method is overridden, the tabstract must be removed.
    - It's difficult to know when a tabstract method is overridden

* TODO Sol-2
  - [ ] Let each SimpleClass have a internal list of tabstract methods.
  - [ ] Let Package SimpleClass check that they have that method
  - [ ] Rename the internal list when copying and merging
